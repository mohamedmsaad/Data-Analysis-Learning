# 🏦 Loan Default Risk - Exploratory Data Analysis

This project explores a loan dataset to identify patterns in loan default behavior using data analysis techniques.

## 📊 Dataset

Loan default data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yasserh/loan-default-dataset), downloaded via `kagglehub`.

## 🔍 Objectives

- Understand default patterns by borrower characteristics
- Visualize key drivers of loan risk
- Clean and prepare data for modeling

## 📌 Key Insights

- Default is highest among applicants with poor credit worthiness
- Certain loan purposes (e.g. debt consolidation) show higher risk
- Owner occupancy tends to reduce default likelihood

## ⚙️ Tools

- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Files

- `Loan_default_EDA.ipynb` – full notebook
- `loan_default_cleaned.csv` – cleaned data (optional)
